            <p>Depending on the input, this can result in using a lot of processing power and time. The whole process would <br> take approximately 5 seconds to return a result to the client. Keep in mind we're talking about 1 item, a contact <br> from a contact book. After a while, a new requirement is added. Solution must support companies that <br> manage their contacts organized in files. We agreed to develop a web application that would support upload <br> of dataset files, like .csv. The new web application should support third party integrations. Some of them are <br> the ESP/CRM services, like Mailchimp. User does not need to see the result immediately. System can later <br> notify the user about the result, when the process finishes. This information is the key that we need to <br> leverage on when developing our solution. So here's how we did it.</p>

            <h1>Initial approach</h1>
            <p>
                Our initial approach went like this: The web application would read a .csv file line-by-line and submit an array <br> of entries to the backend REST API. Processing is in real time, immediately after the user makes a request for <br> the process to start, he expects a result. Another approach is to apply vertical scaling to AWS architecture. <br> Meaning we used larger, more expensive instances that have more RAM and processing power. This system <br> worked well for smaller datasets, maybe up to 5k entries, but for larger datasets multiple problems arose. This <br> solution is prone to failure due to long request time. Also, because of some 3rd party services that aren't <br> optimized for large scale loads or they don't have batch endpoints. 3rd party services also tend to protect <br> their architecture from making a huge bill on their end. The whole process was done in real-time. The request <br> can take a lot of time hanging in there while the backend would do all the work and return the result to the <br> client. The request was limited to 300 seconds (at time of writing the article) before AWS would cancel it… <br> Also I need to mention that the user has to wait a few minutes to see the results. They can't use the app <br> during the process, which makes for a bad user experience.
